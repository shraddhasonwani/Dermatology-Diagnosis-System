# 🩺 Dermatology Diagnosis System

An AI-based **Dermatology Diagnosis System** that helps identify different types of skin diseases using **Deep Learning (CNN)**.  
The system allows users to upload a skin lesion image and predicts the disease class using a trained neural network model.

## 📌 Project Overview

Skin diseases are often difficult to diagnose at an early stage. This project aims to assist dermatologists and users by providing a **computer-aided diagnosis system** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.

The model is trained on the **HAM10000 dataset**, which contains dermatoscopic images of common skin lesions.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User uploads a skin lesion image  
2. Image is preprocessed and resized  
3. CNN model analyzes the image  
4. System predicts the skin disease class  
5. Result is displayed on the web interface
